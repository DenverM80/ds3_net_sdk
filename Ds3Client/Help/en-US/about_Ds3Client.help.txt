Introduction
============

The Ds3Client Windows PowerShell module provides a convenient way to interface with the DS3 protocol.


Endpoint and Credential Configuration
=====================================

To connect to a specified DS3 server you'll need to create a configuration with
the necessary endpoint and credentials. The easiest way to do this is with the
New-DS3Configuration cmdlet. In addition to creating the configuration object
the cmdlet will add the configuration to the current PowerShell session. The
-MakeSelected flag ensures that the new configuration is the currently selected
one.

> New-DS3Configuration -MakeSelected

cmdlet New-DS3Configuration at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
Name: MyConfiguration
Endpoint: http://my.endpoint
AccessKey: TXlBY2Nlc3NLZXk=
SecretKey: TXlTZWNyZXRLZXk=
WARNING: Wrote configuration file to "C:\Users\*username*\Documents\SpectraLogic\BlackPearl\MyConfiguration.xml". Use -DontPersist to prevent this behvior.


Name       : MyConfiguration
Endpoint   : http://my.endpoint/
AccessKey  : TXlBY2Nlc3NLZXk=
SecretKey  : TXlTZWNyZXRLZXk=
IsSelected : True


New-DS3Configuration will also save the configuration to a file within the
current user's documents directory by default, which you can later import into
another PowerShell session using Import-DS3Configuration.

> Import-DS3Configuration -MakeSelected "C:\Users\*username*\Documents\SpectraLogic\BlackPearl\MyConfiguration.xml"


Cmdlets interacting with buckets and objects will use the current PowerShell
session's currently selected configuration by default. Alternatively you may
provide the -Configuration flag to override this behavior.


Cmdlets at a Glance
===================

The module contains the following cmdlets:

- Configuration
    New-DS3Configuration
    Import-DS3Configuration
    Get-DS3Configuration
    Select-DS3Configuration
    Remove-DS3Configuration

- Bucket
    New-DS3Bucket
    Get-DS3Bucket
    Remove-DS3Bucket

- Object
    Read-DS3Object
    Write-DS3Object
    Remove-DS3Object

For help regarding any of these cmdlets use the following command:
> help -Detailed *cmdlet-name*
